Did you know that you can help researchers investigate COVID-19 using spare computing power from your own computer? Researchers from Washington University in St. Louis have done just that, by developing an application called [Folding at Home](https://foldingathome.org/). Folding at Home harnesses the power of computers sitting idle and uses that to compute data researching the DNA and RNA sequences to identify possible vaccine candidates, to help speed up the long, time consuming vaccine process.

Recenntly, I started running Folding@home on my two computers. While they might not be the fastest computers, Folding@home runs off of any computer, and promotes that any bit helps. I'm working on building my own PC, which should be able to process at least 250k pts per day (currently, I am sitting around 30k pts per day, only running during daytime hours). Below you can find specifications of the computers I use:
* Lenovo M70 Desktop
    * Processor: Intel i7-2600S at 2.80 GHz (4 Core, 8 Thread)
    * GPU: None installed, onboard graphics
    * Memory: 16 GB DDR3
    * OS: Windows 10 Home
* Lenovo T570s Laptop
    * Processor: Intel i7-6600U at 2.60 GHz (2 Core, 4 Threads)
    * GPU: Integrated Intel HD Graphics 520
    * Memory: 8 GB DDR4
    * OS: Windows 10 Home

As of 8:00 PM on 6/2, my current contributions to Folding@home are:
* Total Score: 37,382 points
* Total WU: 251 units
