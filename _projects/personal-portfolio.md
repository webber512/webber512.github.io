This 30 page guide was created for my final project in ENG 321, Technical Writing at Missouri State University in the Fall 2019 semester. A common problem amongst College Software Development students is the lack of ability to showcase personal projects. This is designed to serve as an introductory guide to conquer that problem.

## Features
In this guide, you will learn about several popular technologies:
* Markdown
* HTML
* Jekyll
* Git
* GitHub Pages

## Additional Notes
This guide is introductory in nature, and assumes the reader has little knowledge of the technologies involved. There may be better suited tutorials and themes online for users.
