Written to help power projects get accurate, timely, and relevant data regarding the COVID-19 virus. This project serves as a Java wrapper to get data from The Covid Tracking Project, a well-known, reputable, and reliable organization.

## Features
* Built in calls for all functions on The Covid Tracking Project
* Follows schemas according to The Covid Tracking Project for reliable data
* Well documented to ensure accuracy

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to the project, check it out on GitHub. I am currently looking into making it avaliable on a MVN or Gradle repository, making it easier to use in a project. Additionally, any and all testing or additional methods are welcomed.
