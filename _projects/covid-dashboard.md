The Coronavirus Dashboard is a spring boot application designed to provide detailed data visualizations about the Coronavirus Outbreak in the United States, utilizing data from 
<a href="https://covidtracking.com/">The COVID Tracking Project</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/webber512/covid-data-library">Java COVID Data Library Wrapper</a>. Designed with Bootstrap 4.5, the Coronavirus Dashboard is designed to work on screens of all sizes, showing critical and accurate data about the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
